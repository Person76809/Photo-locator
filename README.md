# Photo-locator
This code is able to give the location of a photo 

To extract the geolocation information from a photo, you can use a Python script with the help of the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library and the PIL.ExifTags module. Here's an example script that extracts the GPS coordinates from a photo: 

the tkinter library to create a simple file dialog that allows users to select an image file. The script then extracts the geolocation information from the selected photo and displays it in a message box.

To run the script, simply execute it, and a file dialog will appear for selecting the photo. After selecting a photo, the script will display the latitude and longitude information in a message box. If any errors occur during the process, an error message box will be shown.

Please note that this script requires the tkinter module, which is typically included with standard Python installations. If you encounter any issues related to tkinter, make sure it is properly installed and configured on your system. 

Make sure to replace 'path/to/your/photo.jpg' with the actual path to your photo file. The script will attempt to extract the latitude and longitude values from the photo's EXIF data if it contains GPS information. If successful, it will print the latitude and longitude. Otherwise, it will display an appropriate error message.

Note that not all photos may contain GPS information
